A lambda function is a small anonymous function, which returns an object 
the object returned by lambda is usually assigned to a varible or used as 
a part of other bigger functions 

Instead of the conventional def keyword used for creating functions a lambda
function is defined by using the lambda keyword. The structure of lambda can 
be seen below:

lambda arguments: expression

a lambda can have multiple arguments separated by commas
Every lambda begins with the "lambda" keyword 
A colon(:) precedes the expression
the expression always return an object 

The purpose of lambdas

A lambda is much more readable than a full function since it can be written in 
-line. So it's a good practice to use lambdas when the function expression is 
small

The beauty of lambda function is in the fact that return function object .
This makes them helpful when used with function like map or filter, which require funcion 
object as arguments.
