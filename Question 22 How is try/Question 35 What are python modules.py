A python module is a Python file containing a set of function and variables 
to be used in an application. The variables can be of any type arrays, diction
, object, etc 

Modules can be either built in or user-defined.

Benefits of modules in Python 

There are a couple of benefits of creating and using a module in Python 
Structured Code: Logicaaly organized by being grouped into one Python file 
which makes development easier and less error-prone, code is easier to 
understand and use 

Reusability : Functionality defined in a single module can be easily 
reused by other parts of the application..

This eliminates the need to create duplicate code.
