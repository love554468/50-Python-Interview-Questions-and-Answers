The join method in Python takes elements of an iterable data structure 
and connects them together using a particular string connector value. 

How does join work?

the join method in Python is a string method, which connects elements of a 
string iterable structure, which also contains string or characters
(array, list, etc) by using a particular string as the connector 

connector.join(iterable)

connector : the string that will be used to join the elements of the array 
iterable: the array whose elements will be joined together.

Example: 
",".join(['1','2','3'])
