An exception is an error that occurs while the program is executing when 
this error occurs the program will stop and generate an exception which 
then gets handled in order to prevent the program from crashing 

The exceptions generated by a program are caught in the try block and 
handled in the except block.

Try: Lets you test a block of code for errors.
Except:Lets you handle the error
