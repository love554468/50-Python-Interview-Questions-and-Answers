The ternary operator is a way of writing conditional statements in Python. 
As the name ternary suggests, this Python operator consists of three 
operands. 

Note: the ternary operator can be thought of as a simplified, one-line 
version of the if -else tate ment to test a condition 

Value1 if condition else value2 

if true -> value1 else value2
