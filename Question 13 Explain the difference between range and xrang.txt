for the most part, xrange and range have exactly the same functionality
The both generate a list of integers for u to use. 
The only difference is that range returns a python list object and xrange
returns as xrange object 

This means that xrange doesn't actually generate a static list at runtime
as range does. It creates the values as u need them with a special technique
called yielding . This technique is uesed with a type of object know
as generators.
