Nemory management is handled by the Python private heap space
All python object and data structures are located in a private heap 
The programmer doesn't have access to this private heap
The python interpreter takes care of this instead
Heap space for python object is allocated by Python's memory manager
The core API give access to some tool for the programmer to code.
Pyhon aslo has an in buit garbage collector , which recycles all the unused
memory and so that it can be made avaiable to the heap space
